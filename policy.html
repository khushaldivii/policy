                    <p><b>How we use this information collected in our Games (Terms of Use)</b></p>
                    <p>We collect this Information to improve performance and reliability of our Games and to get a better understanding of what users in general prefer.

                    <p>Our mobile applications comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”).

                    <p>We take care of filtering categories of sensitive and unsuitable ads for children. But rarely can an advertiser misclassify your ads, and this situation is beyond our reach.</p>
